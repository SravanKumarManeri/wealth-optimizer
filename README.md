Wealth Optimizer is a privacy-focused financial tool designed to help users eliminate debt through mathematical optimization. Unlike traditional apps that require invasive bank logins, Delta-Wealth uses local CSV parsing and the "Avalanche Method" logic to project a definitive debt-free timeline without ever storing user data.
